t값에 따른 결과 
----------
t = 0.5, 반복적이고 문법적 오류가 발생하는 결과를 보임

t = 0.8, 좀 다양해지고 자연스러워짐

t = 1.2, 의미 없는 단어 조합 발생

해석
----
t값에 따라 확률분포의 모양이 달라지며 t = 0.8에서의 확률분포가 모델이 가장 높은 확률의 문자를 선택할 가능성을 높이면서도, 다양한 선택을 가능하게 하여 텍스트의 자연스러움을 유지한다고 볼 수 있음

미세하게 val_loss가 낮아 RNN을 선택했지만 LSTM에서 생성한 sample을 보면 t = 0.8일때 가장 자연스러웠음
